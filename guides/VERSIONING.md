Version control of Repositories
===============================

Following [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).
* The first stable release for repositories, either libraries or services, is `1.0.0`

* When creating release branches or tags it is digital publishing standard to not increment the patch version and hence should always be zero; (`Major.Minor.Patch = 1.0.0`)

* Any new release will force the version to go up by either a minor or major version, see examples below:

```
Current version is 1.1.0

* Minor release updates version to 1.2.0
* Major release updates version to 2.0.0
```
