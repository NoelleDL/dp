Version control of Repositories
===============================

Following [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

* When creating release branches or tags it is our standard to not use the patch version (`1.0.0 = Major.Minor.Patch`)

* Any new release will force the version to go up by either a minor or major version, see examples below:

```
Current version is 1.1.0

* Minor release updates version to 1.2.0
* Major release updates version to 2.0.0
```
