Welcome pack
============

* The welcome pack uses [RelaxedJS](https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed) - you can install it with `npm i -g relaxedjs`

* Running `make` will build a PDF for each of the guides. Be aware that the 'Your first few weeks' guide will be populated with a default name of 'Somebody'
